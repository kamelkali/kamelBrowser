# My own personal web browser!

A long time ago i created my own web browser in PyQT5.
Simple web browser with discord rich presence. **Some sites may not work!**

Discord stauts will be updated after page loading completed 
I tried to recode that in PyQT6, but i had a lot of error and no time to solve that

## How its look ?
